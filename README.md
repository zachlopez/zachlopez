##### 🏗️ Active Projects

###### NemoBlocks
A block programming interface used to generate NodeJS programs. It includes custom blocks allowing users to program the NemoBot chat bot for messenger. The application has live translation from block to higher-level code, allowing students to make the transition to proper computer languages. The application can be accessed [here](http://34.96.181.100:3000/).

###### TigerAmbush
A chat room application for Princeton students. It was made during the COVID pandemic to recreate the experience of random meetups which disappeared in the virtual environment. The application can be accessed with a Princeton account [here](http://tigerambush.herokuapp.com/).
